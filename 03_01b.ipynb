    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a powerful class of deep neural networks primarily used for processing image data. CNNs have proven extremely effective in image classification, object detection, and facial recognition tasks. In this tutorial, we'll build a CNN using Keras and TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct categories.\n",

    "+ Learn how to preprocess image data for deep learning.\n",
    "+ Build a simple CNN using Keras and TensorFlow.\n",
    "+ Train and evaluate the CNN model.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before we begin, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Basic knowledge of Python programming (variables, functions, loops).\n",
    "+ Understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts.\n",
