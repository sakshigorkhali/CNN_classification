    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use a pretrained **YOLO** model for **object detection** in Python. Object detection is one of the most common tasks in computer vision. It involves identifying and localizing every instance of objects within an image. The output of an object detector includes the coordinates of the bounding boxes around each image, the predicted class for each box, and a confidence score indicating how certain the model is about each detection. Object detection is especially useful when we need to know what objects are present in an image as well as where they are located.\n",

    "YOLO, short for \"You Only Look Once\", is a family of high-performance deep learning models designed for real-time object detection. These models perform detection by framing detection as a single regression problem, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. YOLO object detection models are trained on the **COCO** dataset and offer a range of model sizes (nano, small, medium, large, and extra large) that balance speed and accuracy for various applications.\n",
