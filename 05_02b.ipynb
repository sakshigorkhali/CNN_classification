    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use a pretrained **YOLO** model for **image classification** in Python. Image classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision. It involves assigning a single label to an entire image based on the dominant object or scene it contains. The output of an image classifier is a class label along with a confidence score indicating how certain the model is about its prediction. This task is especially useful when you're interested in identifying what type of object is present in an image, without needing to know its exact location or shape.\n",

    "YOLO, short for \"You Only Look Once\", is a family of high-performance deep learning models originally designed for real-time object detection. However, recent versions of YOLO have been adapted for image classification tasks as well, offering a powerful combination of speed and accuracy across a range of model sizes. Unlike traditional classification models, YOLO models are optimized for fast inference, making them suitable for edge devices and real-time applications. \n",
