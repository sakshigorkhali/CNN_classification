    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use a pretrained **YOLO** model for **image segmentation** in Python. Image segmentation is one of the most common tasks in computer vision. It involves partitioning an image at the pixel level so that each pixel is assigned to a specific class or object instance. The output of a segmentation model includes pixel-wise masks for each detected region, class labels, bounding boxes, and confidence scores indicating how certain the model is about each prediction. This approach is especially useful when you need to know not just what objects are present but also the precise shape and extent of each object.\n",

    "+ A working knowledge of Python, including variables, functions, loops, and basic object-oriented programming.\n",
    "+ A Python (version 3.x) environment with the `ultralytics`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `Pillow` packages installed.\n",
